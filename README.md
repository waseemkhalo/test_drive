# Introduction
Welcome to my Flutter Random Word Application! This project marks the beginning of my journey with Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications. The essence of this application is its simplicity and focus on user interaction with words.

## Features
- **Random Word Generator:** Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a randomly generated word. This feature is the core of the application, providing a unique word each time.
- **Favoriting Words:** Users have the option to 'favorite' a word they find interesting or significant. This adds the word to a special list, allowing users to revisit their favorite words later.
- **Skipping Words:** Not every word will resonate with the user. Thus, the app includes the option to skip a word, which then leads to the presentation of a new random word.
- **Navigation Rail:** The app includes a straightforward navigation rail with two primary destinations:
    - **Home:** The main screen where users interact with the random word generator.
    - **Favorited Words:** A separate list where users can view all the words they have marked as favorites.
